<h1>What Is Freemasonry?</h1>
  <h2>Freemasonry</h2>
  <p>Although is is important to understand what FreeMasonry is it is more important
    to first understand what it isn't. </p>
  <p>Freemasonry, contrary to what you may read on some internet sites, is not
    a religion or a religious cult nor does it make any pretence to be one however
    it does require that a member believe in a Supreme Being. Men of all faiths
    have become Freemasons because the principles Freemasonry espouses are compatible
    with the teachings of the recognized faiths of the world. It urges its members
    to be faithful and devoted to their own religious beliefs.</p>
  <p>Freemasonry is not an organization that provides material gain
    or advancement to its membership. In fact it is strictly forbidden to talk
    about business or religion in open lodge. </p>
  <h2>So what is Freemasonry?	</h2>
  <p>Freemasonry is the oldest and largest world wide fraternity dedicated to
    the Brotherhood of Man under the Fatherhood of a Supreme Being. </p>
  <p>A Freemason is a man of faith, who uses tools of moral and ethical principles
    to serve mankind. He binds himself to like-minded men in a brother­hood that
    transcends all religious, ethnic, social, cultural and educational differences.<br>
He shows the aspirations and obligations of men of good will who seek to make
themselves better than they are - not better than others.</p>
  <p>A Freemason is dedicated - he recognizes his responsibility for justice,
    truth, charity, honesty and integrity. Freemasons work building their lives
    and character, just as a carpenter works at building a house.<br>
A Freemason believes that there is such a thing as honour, and that a man has
a responsibility to act with honour in everything he does. </p>
  <p>A Freemason teaches
    that principle. He believes that a life not founded on honour is hollow and
    empty - that a man who acts without honour is less than a man.</p>
  <p>A Freemason believes that it is not only more blessed to give than to receive,
    it's also more rewarding. He becomes involved with problems and needs of
    others because he knows it gives each of us a good feeling to help, a feeling
    unlike any other.</p>
  <p>A Freemason believes that every person should strive to
    be a good citizen and that he has a moral duty to be true to the country
    in which he lives, for loyalty to one's country is essential. He is expected
    to obey every lawful authority, obey the laws of the country in which he
    lives and promote its general welfare. In no way do these requirements interfere
    with a Freemason's civil right to protest and seek legislative changes by
    lawful means.</p>
  <p>Freemasons and the Masonic family contribute not only their
    money, but also an incredible amount of time to various charities. Internationally
    the Masonic Family donates over three million dollars per day to various
    charitable works. Much of our help is given anonymously. We're not after
    gratitude. We're more than rewarded by that feeling which comes from knowing
    we have helped another person over­come some adversity, so that their life
    can go on.</p>
  <h2>How to become a Freemason</h2>
    <p>One of the unique features of Freemasonry is that no man is ever invited
      to become a member. Freemasons are prohibited from the solicitation of
      new members. For that reason, it is sometimes difficult for an interested
      person to discover how to approach the fraternity for membership.</p>
    <p>It is easy, however, to find out; just contact a Freemason and ask him
      about Freemasonry. You probably know several Freemasons. Perhaps you have
      seen the Square and Compasses like the one on this brochure, on a ring,
      pin, or bumper sticker. Drop by the Lodge in your community, stop by or
      look up the phone number and give them a call or contact the Secretary
      at St. James Lodge. </p>
    <p>You will have to fill out an application form, which
      is found here. Freemasonry offers much to its members - the opportunity
      to grow, the chance to make a difference, to build a better world for ourselves
      and our children. It offers the chance to be with and work with men who
      have the same values and ideals.</p>
    <p> Freemasonry is always ready to welcome good men into the fraternity.
      It's ready to welcome you. </p>
